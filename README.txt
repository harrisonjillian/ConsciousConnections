Conscious Connections

General Information

This .NET Framework MVC 5 Web Application uses n-tier architecture focusing on the data, model, service and WebMVC layers.  In this application a company can create products and view the reviews that users have left on the products as well as write their own.

The primary purpose in creating this application was to create an easily accessible path for all people to effortlessly find and review products that are sustainable to the environment while supporting socially conscious businesses. We want to help improve people’s lives while supporting businesses that are improving the planet.  Companies add their own products to this page and have the opportunity to showcase their activism in their product description and by verifying what certifications they have. It makes purchasing selections easier as it’s less overwhelming and you can easily see the reviews.
